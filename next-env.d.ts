// Fixed: Removed triple-slash references that were causing "Cannot find type definition file" errors.
// These directives were failing because the 'next' package is not correctly resolved in the current environment.

// NOTE: This file should not be edited
// see https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript for more information.
